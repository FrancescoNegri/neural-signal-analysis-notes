\subsection{Introduction}
Synchronized activity among neurons occurs in many brain areas and there are evidences
suggesting that it is relevant for information processing, especially sensory
processing, cognition, and sleep. Patters of reverberating synchronized activity are
believed to reflect neuronal representations of cognitive processes and stored
memories. Notice that this kind of synchronized activity is also observed
\textit{in vitro} in the form of reverberating synchronous activity.\\
Said so, a network burst (NB) can be described straightforward as a synchronized
bursting event involving most units of the network, thus implying that several
channels are exhibiting bursting activity at the same time.

Let's point out that network bursting closely reminds to the \textit{UP} and
\textit{DOWN} states of the \textit{in vivo} cerebral cortex during slow-wave
sleep. In addition, spontaneous network bursting activity is also easily
noticed in developing brain, as it is thought to play a key role in
ontogeny - i.e. the origination and development of an organism -
of a neuronal network.
Moreover, let's recall that a strong correlation between the high frequency (spikes)
and low frequency (LFP) signals exists. Said so, it is possible to individuate mainly
6 types of waves, each one described by a typical frequency range:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Delta: \(0.5-4\,Hz\)
    \item Theta: \(4-8\,Hz\)
    \item Alpha: \(8-11\,Hz\)
    \item Beta: \(11-30\,Hz\)
    \item Low Gamma: \(30-55\,Hz\)
    \item High Gamma: \(55-80\,Hz\)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Example: a Step into Sleep Physiology}
In mammals and birds, sleeping activity is divided into pretty much different
phases, according to the characteristics exhibited by the brain activity.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rapid Eye Movement (REM):} this phase is also known as paradoxical
          sleep and its greatest peculiarities are the fact that eyes are rapidly moving
          and a rapid low-voltage EEG, akng to the awake state.
    \item \textbf{Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM):} this broad category keeps together
          all the phases where the neuronal activity is considerably different w.r.t. the
          awake state. NREM stages can be individuated according to the acivity differences:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item \textbf{N1:} it refers to the transition of the brain from alpha waves
                    (awake state) towards theta waves, having a lower frequency. This stage is
                    often called drowsy sleep.
              \item \textbf{N2:} it is characterized by a phenomenon denominated sleep
                    spindles - i.e. bursts of activity - displaying a pretty higher frequency range
                    (\(11-16\,Hz\)). Another typical phenomenon occurring in this stage is named
                    K-complexes.
              \item \textbf{N3:} this stage is commonly denominated deep sleep and it is
                    characterized by the presence of delta waves (at least \(20\%\) of the
                    overall activity). Notice that delta waves exhibit especially high
                    peak-to-peak voltages (\(>75\,\mu{V}\)).
              \item \textbf{N4:} this stage is usually described as a state in which slow
                    delta waves overcomes the \(50\%\) threshold on the total brain oscillatory
                    activity. It is sometimes considered together with stage N3.
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
There is evidence that network bursting activity is strictly related to the delta
waves typical of deep sleep.

\subsection{Network Burst Detection}
In order to detect network burst, it is necessary to be able to recognize synchronous
increases in the network activity. A number of algorithms have been developed to
solve such a task.
\subsubsection{The Van Pelt Algorithm}
Let's recall the definition of network bursts, as they are short episodes of
synchronized firing among many recording sites. Notice that network bursts are not
exclusively described by increased firing rates at individual sites, but also by an
increase of the number of active sites. This method consists in dividing the time
axis into a number of small bins and computing the product between the number of
active sites - i.e. the recording channels showing firing activity - and the total
number of spikes at these sites. In case of uncorrelated spiking activity among
the sites, this product won't significantly differ from the total spike count, however
it raise sharply as soon as the firing becomes synchronized. The time point at
which the previously illustrated product attains its maximal value is used to
define a center-of-mass-based time center of the network burst.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{7_3}
    \centering
\end{figure}
The figure above shows the following plots:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{(A)} The time points of spikes at the different recording sites of
          a multi-electrode array. The lowest trace shows the total spike train for all
          the sites.
    \item \textbf{(B)} A total network firing rate plot with time bins of \(1\,s\).
    \item \textbf{(C)} A total network firing rate plot with time bins of \(25\,ms\).
    \item \textbf{(D)} A plot of the number of active sites with time bins
          of \(25\,ms\).
    \item \textbf{(E)} A plot of the product of total number of spikes and the
          number of active sites, calculated per \(25\,ms\) time bins. The dashed line
          represents a threshold to overcome to identify an actual network burst, which
          are individuated by a star.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{The LogISI Method}
This technique requires instead that burst detection has been performed for every
recording channel. Then, a burst event train for each channel is derived, where
bursts are described as single point events, disregarding every information about
their duration. These points for all the sites are then projected onto the same axis.
Now it is possible to perform once again burst detection on this new axis, allowing
to look for time periods with an increased bursting activity on several channels, thus
synchronized. This algorithm consists in an iterative application of burst detection
procedures. Notice that the minimum number of intra-burst spikes for the cumulative
burst event train can be intended as the minimum number of active channels required
to detect a network burst event, usually set as the \(20\%\) of the total number of
recording sites.

\subsection{Metrics}
Some of the most relevant metrics to characterize netowrk bursting are reported
in the following.
\subsubsection{The Burstiness Index}
The burstiness index (\(BI\)) metric was empirically derived by D. A. Wagenaar in order to assess the burstiness
of a neuronal network with just one number. From experiments, it has been notice that
in general the overall time occupied by network bursts in a whole recording is
always less than \(15\%\) of the total duration and this has been taken as an
assumption for the computation of constants employed to derive the burstiness
index. The computation steps are reported here:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Divide a 5 minutes recording into 300 time bins (each 1 second long).
    \item Count the total number of spikes for each bin, across all the recording sites.
    \item Compute the fraction of the total number of spikes contained in the \(15\%\),
          of bins with the largest counts, indicated as \(f_{15}\).
          \begin{itemize}
              \item If the firing rate is tonic, then \(f_{15}\) is expected to be close to 0.15.
              \item If a recording is bursty, it is likely that most of the spikes will
                    be contained in bursts, resulting in \(f_{15}\) close to 1.
          \end{itemize}
    \item Compute the burstiness index normalized between 0 and 1 as
          \begin{align*}
              BI = \frac{f_{15}-0.15}{0.85}
          \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Major Burst Leaders}
Each network burst is spreaded through the recording sites according to a specific
spatio-temporal pattern, resulting in a precise sequence in the electrodes activation.
Major Burst Leaders (MBLs) are the priviliged nodes in the network that consistently
fire earlier than the others at the onset of the netowrk bursts. It is critical to
individuate them, as they play the role of leaders of the synchronized bursting
activity. It is important to point out that the pool of MBLs is stable across hours,
although the leadership frequency of individual channels may vary. A further comment
is that MBLs are not unique, while the Burst Leader (BL) consists in the node
- i.e. the neuron - initiating the network burst and it is unique, even if it may
change in time, as it is one of the MBLs, but not always the same.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{7_5}
    \centering
\end{figure}
Each node is given a certain leadership score, as shown in the figure above, according
to its relevance in the initiation of a bursting event. If such score overcomes a
certain threshold (indicated by the dotted line), then the node is identified as
one of the MBLs.\\
Another crucial phenomenon is the recruitment of MBLs, as a matter of fact MBLs
promptly recruit other MBLs in the network burst pathway. By recruitment it is meant
to activate other nodes in order to facilitate the initiation of a network burst.
In addition, MBLs are involved in network bursting activity with high reliability
if compared to other common nodes, exhibiting a reliability \(>90\%\).
\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{7_6}
    \centering
\end{figure}
At this point, one might wonder if MBLs represent the most active channels in terms
of spikes. Although no correlation between the leadership score and the fraction of
spikes outside network bursts have been assessed, it has been observed that almost
all MBLs have a sustained spiking activity, with an average firing rate higher than
the network average. Moreover, it seems that their response to electrical stimulation
is indeed stronger and faster than those of common neurons.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{7_7}
    \centering
\end{figure}
A possible interpretation of this phenomenon could be that MBLs receieve a large number
of incoming excitatory connections, therefore they act as network hubs, integrating
several inputs and redistributing them to the network.
