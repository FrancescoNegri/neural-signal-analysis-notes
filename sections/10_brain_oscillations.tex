\subsection{Introduction}
The term "\textbf{brain (or neural) oscillations}" refers to the rhythmic and/or repetitive electrical 
activity generated spontaneously or in response to stimuli in the central 
nervous system. The importance of brain oscillations in sensory-cognitive processes has become 
increasingly evident. This chapter will focus on some questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What does a neural oscillation consist of and how does it originate?
    \item What are the (main) roles of brain oscillations?
    \item How do we observe a brain oscillation?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{EEG and MEG}
In the brain, what usually happens is that a current travels along the axons of the dendrites generating an electrical 
field that is summed among many cells and finally reaches the sensors.\\
Electroencephalography (EEG) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG) are the main classical techniques to record the electrical activity of the human brain in a non-invasive way. They are based on systems 
that exploit the electrical field and the magnetic field, respectively, but, in general, they record two different aspects 
of the same event:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The EEG records the electrical field and, for this reason, the unit of measurement is volts (typically 
    microvolts, \(10^{-6}\,V\)).
    \item The MEG records the magnetic induced component in a static magnetic field where the head of the person is 
    immersed. The unit of measurement is tesla (typically femtotesla, which corresponds to \(10^{-15}\,T\)).
\end{itemize}
One of the main differences between these two techniques is the acquisition system: EEG 
uses sensors placed on the scalp and wires (one for each electrode) connected to an amplifier, which is needed because 
electrical fields have a power that has to be magnified, while MEG requires dedicated and specially built rooms and 
more intensive and expensive maintenance.
Another drawback of MEG is the fact that the coils used to acquire the signals are fixed, hence, if the subject moves his head, there is a 
a magnetic induction even though no current is travelling, making data completely useless.\\
One of the main reasons to acquire and look at MEG instead of EEG is the fact that magnetic fields pass through the 
skull and scalp, whereas the electrical fields are volume conducted through these tissues. This causes a decrease of the 
signal-to-noise ratio at higher frequencies (performing a low-pass filtering). For this reason, MEG signals have a 
better spatial resolution (better localization power), and this could be useful, for instance, 
for clinical purposes (i.e., for studying epilepsy).

\subsubsection{Origin of EEG Signals}
EEG is not so different from what has been said regarding local field potentials, but it has one more 
problem caused by the fact that the sensors are not located into the brain but outside it, and so the signal has to travel all the distance 
from the source up to the electrodes. EEG is the synchronized synaptic activity in populations of cortical neurons 
closer to the electrode, hence at the electrode a spatial integration is performed (net sum). 
The spatial integration is tightly related to the differences of \textbf{orientation} between the neurons.
\par\medskip
Electrodes detect the sum of positive and negative charges in their vicinity. In the case where an electrode is 
equidistant from both \textit{source} (region of positive charge) and \textit{sink} (region of negative charge) 
of a dipole, the electrode will measure a net neutral charge; so, an electrode can only detect dipoles when it is  
closer to either the positive or negative end of the dipole. This means that mainly two types of dipoles are 
measurable in EEG: \textbf{tangential dipoles}, which are perpendicular to the scalp surface (left figure), and \textbf{radial
dipoles}, which are parallel to it (right figure). Dipoles have a positive and negative side, 
and therefore can produce both a positive deflection and a negative deflection in different regions of the scalp.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{10_1}
    \centering
\end{figure}
In general, a single neuron's dipole is too small to be measured at the scalp. However, electrodes detect the 
sum of charges in their vicinity, which in this case corresponds to the sum of dipoles from multiple neurons, that can be considered as a single dipole whose magnitude is proportional to the number of neurons whose 
dipoles are being summed together. But since both positive and negative 
ends of dipoles in the brain are summed, in order to produce a nonzero signal, neurons must be both arranged in a 
\textit{parallel manner}, and active in a \textit{synchronous way}. If this doesn't happen, in fact, the individual dipoles' positive and negative ends will cancel each other out.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{10_2}
    \centering
\end{figure}
Finally, the electrical field moves in space to reach the sensors (and this phenomenon can 
be called \textbf{Volume Conduction}). When the signal reaches the outer skull layers, if there is not a layer 
that facilitates the passage of ions, it is not possible to record anything. At this purpose a conductive gel can 
be used.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.40]{10_3}
    \centering
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{EEG (Simplified) DAQ}
In the following image, it is possible to see a simplified model of 
the EEG acquisition system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The first element is the \textbf{sensor}, that has some sort of resistance (\(R_1\)), representing 
    the scalp.
    \item Then there is a \textbf{cable}, that is used to connect the sensor to the amplifier. 
    Its resistance is \(R_2\).
    \item The last part is the \textbf{amplification system}, with a resistance \(R_3\).
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.30]{10_4}
    \centering
\end{figure}
For the reasons said before, \(R_1\) must be as low as possible to permit the ions to reach the sensors. Also the 
resistance of the cable (\(R_2\)) needs to be very small, in order not to have any loss of the signal. On the other hand, \(R_3\) should be very large, compared to other ones: it must be orders of 
magnitude larger than the sum of the two. 
In fact, if the dimension of \(R_3\) is comparable to the one of \(R_1\) and \(R_2\), the largest fraction of the recorded 
activity is not dependent on the signal but is mainly noise introduced by the sources \(A\) and \(B\).\\
Conversely, if there is a very huge amplifier resistance, what happens is that the potential will be equally 
dependent from the noise and the signal itself, and this allows to have a better signal-to-noise ratio.
Modern acquisition systems tend to improve these two factors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Increase of \(R_3\).
    \item Reduce the distance between the amplifier and the sensors. A large part of the modern systems has a pre-amplification, 
    that is directly attached to the sensors.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{EEG Principles and Good Practice}
What does it need to be monitored to get the best possible data?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Care in collection}: it is necessary to pay attention on the amount of gel introduced, depending on the quantity 
    of channels on the top of the head and on the size of the head. If the electrodes are very close to each other, 
    the conductive gel can create a so-called \textit{bridge} that attaches two sensors together.
    \item \textbf{Care in interpretation}: as said before, at the sensor level neurons can have many different orientations and this factor 
    must be taken into account. The dipoles measured by EEG consist of both positive and negative sides, and a positive EEG 
    deflection measured at a particular location will be balanced by a negative deflection elsewhere on the scalp. Thus, based only on the 
    deflection of an EEG signal, an observer cannot infer whether the generator caused an excitatory or inhibitory current.
    \item \textbf{Care in localization}: the spatial resolution of the EEG is very poor, because of the \textit{volume conduction} problem. Sources all over the brain may contribute to a measured signal at the scalp. The task of knowing only the final surface voltage pattern and working 
    backwards to determine which sources within the brain produced that voltage pattern is called \textit{inverse problem}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{EEG as a Critical-State System}
The activity acquired using EEG is something that has not a single central part of the brain that acts as "master" to explain the 
overall evolution of the system: the brain, such as many other complex systems in nature, evolves in a so called "\textbf{critical dynamics}".\\
For this reason, the brain activity is not trivial, nor automatic, nor repetitive: it evolves in time and changes to different states.
There is no interest in understanding how a single neuron interacts with the others, but in evaluating how the system evolves and how dynamically 
changes patterns of connectivity.To understand it, \textbf{brain oscillations} can be studied.

\subsection{Constituents of Brain Oscillations}
Brain oscillations can be observed looking at EEG signals (that have a very fast temporal resolution, between \(200\,Hz\) and \(300\,Hz\)).
Neuronal networks in the mammalian forebrain demonstrate several oscillatory bands covering frequencies from approximately \(0.05\,Hz\) to \(500\,Hz\).\\
Brain oscillations are observed in terms of mainly three elements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Frequency}: information on how fast the oscillation is travelling.
    \item \textbf{Phase}: information about the temporal occurency of a specific pattern.
    \item \textbf{Amplitude}: information on how large the oscillation is.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{10_5}
    \centering
\end{figure}
From the figure it is possible to see the different "Brain Bands" or "EEG Bands". A logarithmic scale is used because the amplitude of EEG 
signals decays following a power-law behavior (hence, the representation is linear in a double-logarithmic scale).

\subsubsection{Oscillations Regulate Neuronal Processing}
Neurons communicate through spikes, but LFPs have the ability to control spikes: in this sense, 
oscillations are not just a secondary elements of the true activity (and so, in this sense they are not epiphenomena).\\

\textbf{Example:}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{10_6}
    \centering
\end{figure}
In this example two signals are recorded from different brain areas (Area \(A\) and Area \(B\)), having access on both Local Field Potentials and spiking 
activity. When the oscillations of the field potentials of the two regions are in opposed phase, the region which generated the activity (the one that is 
trying to communicate) will be blocked by the fact that the local field potential in the other region has a reduction in voltage (that inhibits the voltage-dependent 
channels). If the oscillations are in perfect alignment, what happens is exactly the opposite: if one brain region fires, the other responds, producing an effective \textbf{
communication}. This allows to conclude that \textbf{temporal synchronization between field potentials is supportive for neural activity}.\\
By looking at the LFPs, it is possible to make a link between physiology and cognition.

\subsubsection{Communication Through Coherence Theory}
The hypothesis has been formalized by Fries P., in 2005 and 2015. His theory, called "\textit{Communication through coherence framework}", says that if two populations 
have field activities that are "\textbf{coherent}" in time, (which in the sense of Fries means "synchronized"), when one stimulus reaches one population, the same stimulus 
can reach also the other population. On the other hand, when the two are not aligned, given the fact that the oscillations control the excitation and the excitatory cycle 
of the target cells, the signal will not propagate in the network.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.40]{10_7}
    \centering
\end{figure}
This framework can be directly applied to couples of neurons, neuronal ensembles or brain regions, meaning that 
it's \textbf{scale-free}.\\
Looking at the second image, if there is a stimulation (first row), this is perceived by all the populations whose 
excitation is perfectly in phase with the first one (in this case, second row). The misalignment of the first two rows 
is consistent with the distance from the source to the target. An example are Wernicke and Broca, that are two brain 
regions responsible for understanding language (Wernicke) and producing language (Broca). They are connected by a dense number of axons, and the damage of one of the two could be a problem for speaking or understanding language.\\ 
Hence, what has to be considered is not the perfect alignment in time of the two signals in the two regions, but the fact that the misalignment between them (the time delay) has to be coherent with the time that one signal requires to reach the other.\\
If this doesn't happen, i.e., a third population (third row) receives a different input and tries to communicate with the central region (row 2), then the activity will be blocked.

\subsubsection{Oscillations Regulate Context Switching}
On the basis of what has just been said, some structures that are physically linked can be identified (for instance, Wernicke and Broca), with respect to other ones whose connection is more blur (top level networks in the 
cognitive processing). \\
The brain needs to be able to switch 
among different configurations, to process different information simultaneously, and this happens thanks to brain oscillations, that exist at all frequency scales at the same time. gurations, to process different information very differently but simultaneously, and this happens thanks to brain oscillations, because all brain 
oscillations at all frequency scales exist at the same time.gurations, to process different information very differently but simultaneously, and this happens thanks to brain oscillations, because all brain
